/***************************************************************

This is the browser compatibility stylesheet.  The purpose of this
file is to contain all the css 'hacks' that are required to ensure
site uniformity across down-level browsers.

This file will always be the last file included in any page, so
it will have the ability to override any other stylesheet.

Please target your styles at specific problem browsers using 
CSS 'hacks'. Some examples : [http://www.tantek.com/CSS/Examples/]
