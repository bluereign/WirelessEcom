<h1>Supply Chain Disclosure Policy</h1>

<p>The California Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010 requires certain companies to disclose their efforts to eradicate human trafficking and slavery from the supply chains.  At Wireless Advocates, we are committed to conducting our business in a lawful and ethical manner, and we expect the same from our suppliers. Wireless Advocates views our Suppliers (vendors, suppliers, dealers, agents, subcontractors and business partners) as valued extensions of our business and it is important that our Suppliers share our goals on how to do business. We are committed to legal compliance and ethical conduct in our business dealings and we expect our Suppliers to share that commitment.</p>
<p>At this time, Wireless Advocates does not specifically verify product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery, require its suppliers to certify that they meet Wireless Advocates' standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains, require suppliers to comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking, maintain internal standards if employees or suppliers fail to meet slavery and human trafficking standards of Wireless Advocates, or provide training to employees and management on human trafficking and slavery.</p>
