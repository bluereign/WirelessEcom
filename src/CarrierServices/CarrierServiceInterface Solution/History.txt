(Per Randolph) These are the current API methods used in the checkout path for Sprint:

•	NpaNxx                  calls CoverageCheck_Interface
•	CustomerLookupByMDN     calls CustomerInquiry & CheckCreditExistingAccount
•	CheckCredit				calls OrderValidationModule.doCreditCheck
•	ValidateAddress 		stubbed out in SprintCarrierInterface (see 5989)
•	ValidatePortIn          calls PortEligibility


(Per CGeorge) Sprint APIs in service today:

ActivationImpl = EAI_OVM_API_ActivateNow_Interface
CheckCreditExistingAccountImpl = EAI_OVM_API_CreditCheck_Interface
CheckCreditImpl = EAI_OVM_API_CreditCheck_Interface

FYI for you on the below apis with Sprint.  The list of services we have in place today, was given to me by Chris.  They gave us the zip file (I sent to you) with all of their API documentation and I have a preliminary list of what I think we will need to implement to automate the activations (push-button).  Just want to keep you informed, I’ll be updating confluence with a spec and I’m hoping you can start to review this documentation next week.

Thanks,

Subject: RE: PJ 008718 Weekly | Costo (Wireless Advocates) Integration with Sprint

Hi Jill,
Here is the information I promised you today.  I have a couple questions on whether a couple of the APIs correspond to any items on the requirements list we originally went over and if they are I can look at the priority your team set and determine if we will proceed with implementing those as well.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

The AAFES IPs:  
http://test.aafesmobile.com is 68.64.53.107 
http://demo.aafesmobile.com is 68.64.53.106
http://aafesmobile.com is 68.64.53.105

Costco Sprint APIs in service today:

ActivationImpl = EAI_OVM_API_ActivateNow_Interface
CheckCreditExistingAccountImpl = EAI_OVM_API_CreditCheck_Interface
CheckCreditImpl = EAI_OVM_API_CreditCheck_Interface
CustomerLookupByMDNImpl = EAI_OVM_API_AccountValidation_Interface
NpaNxxImpl = OVM_API_CoverageCheck_Interface
PlansRquest = EAI_OVM_API_Plans_Interface
PortEligibilityImpl = EAI_OVM_API_ServiceValidation_Interface

APIs that we will be implementing with this Project:
Activation_Interface
SecurityQuestions_Interface
QueryNubmerPorting Service
BillSummary – is this a requirement, does this API correspond to any of the original requirements in the file we reviewed in the beginning of the project?
Options_Interface – is this a requirement, does this API correspond to any of the original requirements in the file we reviewed in the beginning of the project?



Below are sample error message that you could receive for the scenarios below.
 
<ovm-error-info>
      <error-type>2</error-type>
      <error-code>104</error-code>
      <error-sub-name>PHONE_PLAN_INCOMPATIBLE</error-sub-name>
      <error-details>Plan [PDS1234E] is not compatible with phone [EXIP564WH1]. Service plan ID is [1].</error-details>
   </ovm-error-info>
 
<ovm-error-info>
      <error-type>2</error-type>
      <error-code>105</error-code>
      <error-sub-name>PLAN_INCOMPATIBLE_ID</error-sub-name>
      <error-details>Feature [REQCEL3] is not compatible with service plan [PDS1234L].  The line ID was [1]. Service plan ID is [1].</error-details>
   </ovm-error-info>
   <ovm-response>

These are the most common negative scenarios for activation from Sprint.  I believe some of these errors though are caught on our UI due to rate plan/feature associations to devices.  I could see needed to return these errors when there is an upgrade and the customer is keeping current plan, the new phone may be a 4G and the current plan might be a 3G plan.  I’m asking for the specific errors to associate to these issues.

1.       Verify an error message is returned when adding  a 4G esn with a 3G price plan
2.       Verify an error message is returned when adding a 3G esn with a 4G price plan
3.       Verify an error message is returned if a 3G Hotspot is added to a 4G price plan
4.       Verify an error message is returned if 3G data soc (PDSPREM10) is added to a 4G price plan.
5.       Verify an error message is returned if a 4G data soc (PREM10RC) is added to a 3G price plan.
